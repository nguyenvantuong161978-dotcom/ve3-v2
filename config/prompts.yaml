  ## EXAMPLE 2 - Modern Urban Story:
  If story is about city office life:
  - world_setting.setting = "Modern New York City"
  - characters: wearing suits, business casual
  - locations: glass office buildings, upscale apartments, coffee shops

  ## EXAMPLE 3 - Historical Story:
  If story is set in the past:
  - world_setting.era = "1950s America"
  - characters: period-appropriate clothing
  - locations: period-accurate buildings, cars, decor

  ## MANDATORY RULES:
  1. ALL "name" fields MUST be in ENGLISH (e.g., "Mother", "Courthouse", NOT "Me", "Toa an")
  2. ALL prompts MUST be in ENGLISH
  3. Analyze world_setting FIRST before creating characters/locations

  ## CRITICAL - CHARACTER AGE VERSIONS:
  4. For story narration with flashbacks, create MULTIPLE VERSIONS of main characters:
     - nvc = Narrator PRESENT age
     - nvc_young = Narrator YOUNG ADULT (18-28yo) for adult flashbacks
     - nvc1 = Narrator CHILD (is_child=true, filename=NONE)
     - nv1 = Mother PRESENT age
     - nv1_young = Mother YOUNG (when narrator was child, ~30-35yo)
  5. Each character version needs its own portrait_prompt and character_lock
  6. Add "timeline" field: "PRESENT", "CHILDHOOD_FLASHBACK", "ADULT_FLASHBACK"

  ## CRITICAL - EXTRACT ALL LOCATIONS:
  7. Extract EVERY location mentioned in story:
     - Courthouse, apartment, bedroom, dry cleaning shop, convenience store, construction site, finished house, etc.
  8. Each location needs "timeline" field to match when it appears in story
  9. Create at least 5-7 locations for visual variety in a typical story

  ## CHARACTER RULES:
  10. character_lock MUST have: Age + Gender + Face features + Hair + Skin + CLOTHING
  11. portrait_prompt: MUST have "Pure white studio background", "neutral expression", "looking directly at camera"
  12. Children (is_child=true): portrait_prompt = "DO_NOT_GENERATE", filename = "NONE"
  13. ID format: nvc, nvc_young (narrator), nv1, nv1_young, nv2 (others), nvc1 (child narrator)

  ## LOCATION RULES:
  14. location_prompt: MUST have "Empty, no people"
  15. Add lighting_default appropriate for the scene mood
  16. filename uses .png (NOT .jpg)

  ## OUTPUT:
  17. Return pure JSON only, NO markdown code blocks

  ## VISUAL VARIETY CHECK:
  Before returning, verify you have:
  - [ ] At least 2 versions of narrator (present + young/child)
  - [ ] At least 2 versions of mother if she appears in flashbacks (present + young)
  - [ ] At least 5-7 different locations covering all mentioned places
  - [ ] Timeline tags on all characters and locations
  - [ ] Enough variety to make a visually interesting video (not repetitive!)

# STEP 2: DIRECTOR'S TREATMENT (Visual Story Plan)

# Input: {story_text} - Full story content
# Output: Story structure, emotional arc, visual plan for each part
# THIS STEP IS CRITICAL - Creates the "film blueprint" before individual scenes
# =============================================================================

directors_treatment: |
  You are a Film Director. Read the FULL STORY and create a DIRECTOR'S TREATMENT.
  This is the master plan for how the video will look and feel.

  ## INPUT - FULL STORY:
  ---
  {story_text}
  ---

  ## YOUR TASK:
  Analyze the story like a film director would:
  1. Understand the NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (beginning, middle, end)
  2. Identify EMOTIONAL BEATS (what feelings to evoke at each point)
  3. Plan VISUAL STRATEGY for each part (not every word needs a visual!)
  4. Create a coherent VISUAL NARRATIVE that tells the story effectively

  ## STORY STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:

  ### IDENTIFY THE PARTS:
  Most personal stories have this structure:
  - **HOOK/OPENING**: Grab attention, set up conflict (usually present day)
  - **BACKSTORY**: How we got here (usually flashbacks)
  - **RISING ACTION**: Building toward the conflict
  - **CLIMAX**: The main conflict/confrontation
  - **RESOLUTION**: How it ended, lessons learned

  ### EMOTIONAL ARC:
  Map the emotional journey:
  - Opening: Tension, curiosity, hook
  - Backstory: Warmth, nostalgia, sympathy
  - Rising: Hope, determination, pride
  - Climax: Betrayal, shock, pain
  - Resolution: Justice, closure, reflection

  ## CRITICAL RULES:
  1. UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE STORY before planning visuals
  2. NOT every sentence needs a unique visual - some continue the previous scene
  3. Emotional arc should be CLEAR in the visual treatment
  4. Plan for VARIETY - different locations, different shot types, different moods
  5. The video should FEEL like a film, not a slideshow of unrelated images

  ## YOUR TASK:

  Divide this story into 5-8 PARTS. Each part should:
  1. Have a clear NARRATIVE PURPOSE (hook, setup, conflict, climax, resolution)
  2. Cover a SPECIFIC TIME RANGE from SRT
  3. Focus on specific CHARACTERS and LOCATIONS
  4. Have a clear EMOTIONAL GOAL

directors_shooting_plan: |
  You are a FILM DIRECTOR creating a SHOOTING PLAN for a video.
  Think like a REAL FILM DIRECTOR - CONTENT is KING, images serve the story's GOAL.

  ## CORE PRINCIPLE:
  ```
  TXT (Content) → Divide into PARTS → Each part has a GOAL → Images SERVE that goal
                                              ↓
                                   What should AUDIENCE FEEL?
  ```

  ## 💔 EMOTIONAL DIRECTOR'S GUIDE - HOW TO MAKE AUDIENCE CRY/FEEL

  **🎯 YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL: Touch the audience's HEART, not just their eyes!**

  ### THE 5 EMOTIONAL TECHNIQUES:

  **1. CONTRAST = IMPACT (Tương phản tạo cảm xúc mạnh)**
  ```
  Happy → Sad       = Heartbreak amplified
  Light → Dark      = Tragedy feels darker
  Together → Alone  = Loneliness hurts more
  Rich → Poor       = Sacrifice feels heavier
  Trust → Betrayal  = Wound cuts deeper
  ```
  Example: Show mother-son happy FIRST, then betrayal → audience feels the loss

  **2. SHOW DON'T TELL (Hình ảnh kể chuyện, không cần lời)**
  ```
  Instead of "he was poor":
  → Worn shoes with holes, thin blanket, empty fridge

  Instead of "she worked hard":
  → Calloused hands, sweat on brow, clock showing 11 PM

  Instead of "they were happy":
  → Eyes crinkling with genuine smile, warm embrace, shared laughter
  ```

  **3. UNIVERSAL HUMAN MOMENTS (Khoảnh khắc ai cũng đồng cảm)**
  ```
  - Parent's sacrifice for child
  - Child's love for parent
  - Dreams being crushed
  - Being abandoned by loved one
  - Working hard but still poor
  - Betrayal by someone you trusted
  - Finally achieving after struggle
  ```
  Focus on THESE moments - they touch EVERYONE regardless of culture

  **4. FACE = EMOTION (Khuôn mặt là cửa sổ cảm xúc)**
  ```
  Key emotional moments → MUST SHOW FACE!
  - Tears welling up (not falling yet) = anticipation of sadness
  - Trembling lips = trying not to cry
  - Eyes looking down = shame, defeat
  - Forced smile hiding pain = heartbreaking
  - Clenched jaw = suppressed anger/pain
  ```

  **5. SYMBOLIC OBJECTS (Vật thể mang ý nghĩa)**
  ```
  - Empty chair where someone used to sit = absence, loss
  - Faded photograph = memory, time passed
  - Wedding ring being removed = end of love
  - House being built brick by brick = sacrifice, effort
  - Legal papers = cold bureaucracy vs human emotion
  - Old, worn object still kept = love despite poverty
  ```

  ### 🎬 EMOTIONAL ARC STRUCTURE:

  ```
  HOOK (0-30s):     SHOCK/CURIOSITY → "What happened? I need to know!"
       ↓
  SETUP (30s-2m):   SYMPATHY → "I like this person, I care about them"
       ↓
  BUILD (2m-5m):    INVESTMENT → "I'm rooting for them, I want them to succeed"
       ↓
  CONFLICT (5m-8m): TENSION → "Oh no, things are going wrong..."
       ↓
  CLIMAX (8m-10m):  PEAK EMOTION → "This is so sad/beautiful/moving!"
       ↓
  RESOLUTION:       CLOSURE → "I feel satisfied/reflective"
  ```

  ### ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES THAT KILL EMOTION:

  ```
  ❌ Too many images = audience can't absorb emotion
  ❌ Rushed pacing = no time to feel
  ❌ Generic faces = no connection
  ❌ Text in images = breaks immersion
  ❌ Same lighting throughout = no emotional contrast
  ❌ No close-ups at key moments = missing the emotion
  ```

  ## 🏆 MASTER LEVEL: TECHNIQUES TO MAKE AUDIENCE CRY

  **These are the secrets of great filmmakers - use them to create unforgettable moments!**

  ### 1. THE "ALMOST" TECHNIQUE (Khoảnh khắc "suýt" - mạnh hơn khoảnh khắc thật!)
  ```
  ❌ WEAK: Show tears falling
  ✅ POWERFUL: Show tears WELLING UP, trying NOT to cry

  ❌ WEAK: Show the hug
  ✅ POWERFUL: Show reaching out, hands ALMOST touching

  ❌ WEAK: Show anger
  ✅ POWERFUL: Show jaw clenching, suppressing the scream
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Audience imagines what happens next - their imagination is MORE powerful!

  ### 2. THE SILENT WITNESS (Người chứng kiến im lặng)
  ```
  Instead of showing the sad person:
  → Show someone WATCHING them be sad from afar
  → Parent watching child struggle, helpless
  → Child watching parent work until exhaustion
  → Lover watching from across the room, unseen
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Audience becomes the witness, feels the helplessness!

  ### 3. OBJECTS THAT HOLD MEMORY (Vật thể chứa ký ức)
  ```
  Show objects, not people:
  → Empty chair at dinner table = someone is gone
  → Unworn wedding dress = wedding that never happened
  → Two cups, one untouched = waiting for someone who won't come
  → Old toy kept pristine = child that was lost
  → Faded photograph held carefully = love that remains
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Objects are permanent, people are gone - the contrast destroys!

  ### 4. THE UNFULFILLED PROMISE (Lời hứa chưa thực hiện)
  ```
  Show what COULD HAVE BEEN:
  → House being built (will never be finished)
  → Savings jar for "our future" (future destroyed)
  → Plane tickets never used
  → Wedding invitation never sent
  → Letter never delivered
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Lost potential is more painful than lost reality!

  ### 5. SACRIFICE MADE VISIBLE (Sự hy sinh nhìn thấy được)
  ```
  Show the COST of love:
  → Mother's hands, cracked and bleeding, but holding child's drawing
  → Father's empty plate as children eat
  → Worn shoes walking to work, brand new shoes for child
  → Gray hair appeared overnight from worry
  → Back bent from years of labor
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Love becomes TANGIBLE, you can SEE the price paid!

  ### 6. THE DELAYED REVEAL (Tiết lộ trì hoãn)
  ```
  Build anticipation before emotional payoff:
  Shot 1: Feet walking (whose?)
  Shot 2: Hand on door handle (opening what?)
  Shot 3: Light from inside (what's there?)
  Shot 4: REVEAL - it's the mother, waiting all night for son
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Audience's heart is already racing before the reveal!

  ### 7. VULNERABILITY IN STRENGTH (Yếu đuối trong mạnh mẽ)
  ```
  The STRONGEST person at their WEAKEST:
  → Tough father crying alone in garage
  → Strong mother breaking down when children can't see
  → Angry person finally showing the hurt underneath
  → Provider sitting in empty wallet darkness
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** We see the facade crack - the humanity breaks through!

  ### 8. THE SMALL KINDNESS (Hành động nhỏ, ý nghĩa lớn)
  ```
  Tiny acts that represent enormous love:
  → Tucking blanket over sleeping person
  → Putting extra food on someone's plate
  → Umbrella held more over the other person
  → Walking on traffic side of sidewalk
  → Pretending not to notice tears to spare dignity
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Small kindness = everyday heroism = relatable love!

  ### 9. TIME COMPRESSION (Thời gian nén lại)
  ```
  Years of struggle in ONE image:
  → Same chair, different seasons visible through window
  → Notches on growth chart spanning childhood
  → Stack of identical lunchboxes, each more worn
  → Same path walked, mud → snow → flowers → leaves
  → Calendar pages with X marks, endless waiting
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** Audience feels the WEIGHT of time!

  ### 10. THE UNSAID GOODBYE (Lời chia tay không nói)
  ```
  Partings without words:
  → Back turned, walking away, never looking back
  → Hand slowly releasing from grip
  → Door closing, shadow disappearing
  → Train/bus pulling away, face in window
  → One person staying at gate, other disappearing into crowd
  ```
  **WHY IT WORKS:** What's NOT said hurts more than goodbye!

  ## 🎯 HOW TO APPLY THESE TECHNIQUES:

  For EVERY emotional scene, ask yourself:
  1. Can I show the ALMOST instead of the actual?
  2. Is there a WITNESS to this moment?
  3. What OBJECT holds the meaning?
  4. What PROMISE was broken?
  5. What did this COST them?
  6. Can I DELAY the reveal?
  7. Where is the STRENGTH showing vulnerability?
  8. What SMALL KINDNESS represents the love?
  9. How can I show TIME passing?
  10. What is LEFT UNSAID?

  **USE AT LEAST 2-3 OF THESE TECHNIQUES in every emotional scene!**

  ## YOUR WORKFLOW:

  ### STEP 1: ANALYZE CONTENT (from TXT) - THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT!

  Read the full story and for EACH PART, ask yourself:
  1. What is this part about? (CONTENT)
  2. What is the GOAL of this part? (PURPOSE)
  3. What should the AUDIENCE FEEL? (EMOTION TARGET)
  4. What VISUAL STRATEGY achieves this goal? (HOW)
  5. What KEY IMAGES are needed? (WHAT)

  Example analysis:
  ```
  HOOK (0:00-0:15):
    Content: Mother sues son for the house he built
    GOAL: CREATE SHOCK, spark curiosity
    Audience should feel: "WTF? How could a mother do this?"
    Visual strategy: Dramatic, dark, lonely, overwhelming
    Key images: Tiny man vs imposing courthouse, devastated face

  PART 1 (0:15-0:45):
    Content: Poor childhood, mother worked hard
    GOAL: BUILD SYMPATHY for the son
    Audience should feel: "Poor kid, such a hard life"
    Visual strategy: Warm, nostalgic, intimate, golden hour
    Key images: Leaky thatched house, mother-son working together

  PART 2 (0:45-1:30):
    Content: Son builds house for mother
    GOAL: SHOW SACRIFICE and love
    Audience should feel: "What a devoted son, so much effort"
    Visual strategy: Harsh sunlight, sweat, exhaustion, determination
    Key images: Hands building, sweating under sun, calloused hands

  PART 3 (1:30-2:00):
    Content: House completed, mother cries happy
    GOAL: EMOTIONAL PEAK - happiness
    Audience should feel: "So beautiful, so touching"
    Visual strategy: Radiant light, tears of joy, warm colors
    Key images: Beautiful new house, mother crying happy, embrace

  PART 4 (2:00-2:30):
    Content: Mother evicts son, sues him
    GOAL: SECOND SHOCK - betrayal
    Audience should feel: "Unbelievable! After all he did?"
    Visual strategy: Cold, dark, contrast with Part 3
    Key images: Angry confrontation, legal papers, courthouse
  ```

  ### STEP 2: VISUAL STRATEGY → IMAGES

  Based on GOAL, choose appropriate:

  | GOAL | Lighting | Colors | Camera | Expression |
  |------|----------|--------|--------|------------|
  | SHOCK | Dark, overcast | Cold, desaturated | Low angle, wide | DEVASTATED |
  | SYMPATHY | Golden hour, warm | Warm, nostalgic | Eye level, intimate | TIRED but LOVING |
  | SHOW SACRIFICE | Harsh sunlight | High contrast | Close-up details | DETERMINED, EXHAUSTED |
  | HAPPINESS | Radiant, bright | Warm, vibrant | Medium, two-shot | TEARS OF JOY |
  | BETRAYAL | Cold, harsh | Desaturated | Dutch angle | ANGRY, HURT |

  ### STEP 3: PACING & RHYTHM - THE DIRECTOR'S ART

  SRT tells you the CONTENT WINDOW. But YOU decide the RHYTHM within that window.

  ## 🎬 SHOT DURATION - LIKE A REAL FILM!

  **⚠️ TECHNICAL LIMIT: Maximum 8 seconds per image!**

  **🎯 GOAL: Duration serves the STORY, not a formula!**

  Think like a real film editor - duration depends on CONTENT:
  - Emotional moment needs to breathe? → 7-8 seconds
  - Quick action or reaction? → 2-3 seconds
  - Transition between scenes? → 3-4 seconds
  - Standard narrative? → 5-6 seconds

  **📊 DURATION BY CONTENT (flexible, not rigid!):**

  | Content Type | Duration | Example |
  |--------------|----------|---------|
  | EMOTIONAL PEAK | 7-8s | Tears falling, reunion, realization |
  | ESTABLISHING | 6-8s | New location, setting the scene |
  | NARRATIVE | 5-7s | Normal storytelling |
  | DIALOGUE | 4-6s | Character speaking/reacting |
  | QUICK REACTION | 2-3s | Shock, surprise, glance |
  | ACTION | 2-4s | Fast movement, tension |
  | TRANSITION | 3-4s | Bridge between scenes |
  | DETAIL/OBJECT | 3-5s | Symbolic object, hands |

  **✅ KEY PRINCIPLE:** Let the CONTENT dictate duration, not rules!

  ## 🎵 RHYTHM - LIKE REAL CINEMA!

  **REAL FILMS use VARIED rhythm:**
  ```
  Slow emotional: 8s → 7s → 8s (breathing room)
  Building tension: 6s → 5s → 4s → 3s → 2s (faster!)
  Action sequence: 3s → 2s → 3s → 2s (quick cuts)
  Climax release: 2s → 2s → 8s (burst then breathe)
  ```

  **EXAMPLES from real films:**
  - Sad moment: LONG shot on face (7-8s) - let audience feel
  - Fight scene: QUICK cuts (2-3s each) - energy!
  - Revelation: Medium → Close → LONG hold (4s → 3s → 8s)
  - Montage: Quick shots (3-4s each) - show passage of time

  ## 📊 SHOT COUNT (guideline, not formula!)

  **Approximate: SRT_duration ÷ 5 to 6 = shots needed**

  But VARY based on content:
  - Emotional scene: fewer, longer shots
  - Action scene: more, shorter shots
  - Mixed content: varied durations

  ## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW! ⚠️⚠️⚠️

  ### 🚨 MAXIMUM 8 SECONDS PER SHOT - NEVER EXCEED!

  **This is a HARD TECHNICAL LIMIT. ANY shot with planned_duration > 8 will FAIL!**

  **❌ WRONG:** One 30-second SRT segment = one 30s shot
  **✅ CORRECT:** One 30-second SRT segment = 4-6 shots (each 5-8s)

  ### HOW TO SPLIT SRT SEGMENTS:

  | SRT Duration | Split Into | Example Durations |
  |--------------|------------|-------------------|
  | 10-15s | 2-3 shots | 6s + 5s + 4s = 15s |
  | 15-20s | 3-4 shots | 6s + 5s + 5s + 4s = 20s |
  | 20-30s | 4-5 shots | 7s + 6s + 6s + 5s + 6s = 30s |
  | 30-45s | 5-7 shots | 8s + 7s + 6s + 6s + 5s + 6s + 7s = 45s |
  | 45-60s | 7-10 shots | Split evenly, max 8s each |
  | 60s+ | 10+ shots | MUST split into many shots! |

  ### FORMULA:
  ```
  Number of shots = ceil(SRT_duration / 6)
  Each shot = 2-8 seconds (NEVER more than 8!)
  Total of all shots = SRT_duration exactly
  ```

  ### OTHER RULES:
  - **Duration serves the story** - short is fine when content needs it!
  - **Minimize image count** - fewer images = less viewer fatigue
  - EVERY image must serve the part's GOAL
  - Total shot durations must match SRT segment length exactly

  ## CHARACTER SELECTION - VERY IMPORTANT!

  For each part, decide WHICH CHARACTERS and WHICH VERSION based on TIMELINE:

  ```
  TIMELINE → CHARACTER VERSION:

  PRESENT (Frame story, Hook, CTA):
    - Narrator: nvc (30yo) - current age
    - Mother: nv1 (55yo) - current age

  CHILDHOOD FLASHBACK (8-12 years old):
    - Child narrator: nvc1 (8yo) - DO NOT use in reference_files!
    - Young mother: nv1_young (32yo)

  ADULT FLASHBACK (Building house, 28yo):
    - Young adult narrator: nvc_young (28yo)
    - Older mother: nv1 (55yo)
  ```

  Example character selection per part:
  | Part | Timeline | Narrator | Mother | Notes |
  |------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
  | HOOK | Present | nvc (30yo) | - | Alone at courthouse |
  | CHILDHOOD | Flashback 20yr | nvc1 (8yo) | nv1_young (32yo) | Child NOT in reference_files |
  | BUILDING | Flashback 2yr | nvc_young (28yo) | nv1 (55yo) | Son building house |
  | COMPLETION | Flashback 2yr | nvc_young (28yo) | nv1 (55yo) | House finished |
  | BETRAYAL | Present | nvc (30yo) | nv1 (55yo) | Current conflict |

  ## CHILD CHARACTER RULES:
  - Children (nvc1, etc.) should NOT be in reference_files (API policy)
  - Describe children INLINE in img_prompt: "(Child: 8yo boy, thin, hopeful eyes)"
  - Only use adult references: nv1_young.png, loc_xxx.png

  ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

  1. **🚨 MAXIMUM 8 SECONDS per shot!** (HARD LIMIT - system will REJECT shots > 8s!)
  2. **🚨 MUST SPLIT long SRT segments into multiple shots!**
     - 15s segment → 3 shots (5s + 5s + 5s)
     - 30s segment → 5 shots (6s + 6s + 6s + 6s + 6s)
     - 50s segment → 8 shots (6s + 6s + 6s + 6s + 7s + 6s + 6s + 7s)
     - NEVER create a single shot for a long segment!
  3. **ADD planned_duration to each shot** (integer 2-8 ONLY, based on content)
  4. **Total shot durations MUST EQUAL SRT segment duration exactly**
  5. **Duration serves CONTENT** - 2-3s for action, 7-8s for emotion, 4-6s for narrative
  6. VARY camera angles - don't repeat the same shot type consecutively!
  7. Use characters/locations from the provided lists
  8. Children (nvc1) should be DESCRIBED in img_prompt, NOT in reference_files
  9. Every img_prompt MUST end with the global_style
  10. DO NOT add nationality/ethnicity (Vietnamese, American, etc.) unless EXPLICITLY mentioned in the story
     - If story doesn't mention nationality, just describe features (hair color, skin tone, etc.)
     - Only add nationality when it's RELEVANT to the story
  11. **🎭 CROWD/BACKGROUND CONSISTENCY** - If scene is a party/wedding/event:
     - ALWAYS include crowd/guests in background (even in close-ups: "blurred guests behind")
     - Party without people = ILLOGICAL! Wedding without guests = ILLOGICAL!
     - Match crowd emotion to scene: celebration=cheering, tension=staring, revelation=gasping

  ## ⚠️ LOCATION CONSISTENCY - CRITICAL BUG FIX! ⚠️

  **RULE: The LOCATION in img_prompt MUST MATCH the ACTION described!**

  READ THE SRT TEXT CAREFULLY! If the text says:
  - "on the bed" → Location MUST be bedroom/hotel room, NOT hallway!
  - "in the kitchen" → Location MUST be kitchen, NOT living room!
  - "on the street" → Location MUST be street/outdoor, NOT indoor!

  **BEFORE WRITING img_prompt, ASK YOURSELF:**
  ```
  1. WHERE does this scene ACTUALLY take place? (Read SRT!)
  2. Does my location description MATCH that place?
  3. Are the characters' ACTIONS consistent with the location?
  ```

  **EXAMPLES OF WRONG (DO NOT DO!):**
  - ❌ "Marcus LYING IN BED... Elegant hotel hallway" (BED ≠ HALLWAY!)
  - ❌ "Woman COOKING... Modern office space" (COOKING ≠ OFFICE!)
  - ❌ "Couple SWIMMING... Restaurant interior" (SWIMMING ≠ RESTAURANT!)

  **EXAMPLES OF CORRECT:**
  - ✅ "Marcus LYING IN BED... Master bedroom, king-sized bed, silk sheets"
  - ✅ "Woman COOKING... Modern kitchen, stove, pots, ingredients"
  - ✅ "Couple SWIMMING... Pool, blue water, sunlight"

  **IF SRT MENTIONS A SPECIFIC ROOM/PLACE:**
  - "master bedroom" → Use "Master bedroom, king-sized bed, elegant furniture"
  - "courthouse" → Use "Courthouse exterior/interior, columns, official"
  - "restaurant" → Use "Restaurant interior, tables, elegant dining"

  ## 🎭 SCENE LOGIC & CROWD CONSISTENCY - CRITICAL! 🎭

  **PROBLEM: Scenes look ILLOGICAL when background doesn't match the situation!**

  A PARTY without people = ILLOGICAL!
  A WEDDING without guests = ILLOGICAL!
  A RESTAURANT without diners = ILLOGICAL!

  **RULE: EVERY scene must have LOGICAL BACKGROUND ELEMENTS!**

  ### CROWD LOGIC TABLE:

  | Scene Type | MUST INCLUDE in img_prompt |
  |------------|---------------------------|
  | PARTY/CELEBRATION | "crowd of guests in background", "people mingling", "festive atmosphere with attendees" |
  | WEDDING | "wedding guests seated in rows", "audience watching ceremony", "guests in formal attire" |
  | RESTAURANT | "other diners at nearby tables", "busy restaurant atmosphere", "waiters moving between tables" |
  | OFFICE | "coworkers at desks in background", "busy office environment", "people working at computers" |
  | SCHOOL | "other students in classroom", "students walking in hallway", "busy campus" |
  | FUNERAL | "mourners in black", "crowd of grieving people", "solemn attendees" |
  | STREET | "pedestrians walking", "busy sidewalk", "people in background" |
  | MALL/STORE | "shoppers browsing", "customers in background", "busy retail environment" |
  | HOSPITAL | "nurses and doctors in background", "other patients visible", "busy medical staff" |
  | CONCERT/EVENT | "crowd cheering", "audience with raised hands", "packed venue" |

  ### HOW TO WRITE CROWD IN IMG_PROMPT:

  **❌ WRONG (No crowd - illogical):**
  ```
  "WIDE shot of gender reveal party. Man standing ALONE holding remote control.
  Blue smoke clouds. Sunny day. Cinematic."
  ```
  → This is a PARTY but where are the GUESTS?!

  **✅ CORRECT (Crowd included):**
  ```
  "WIDE shot of gender reveal party. Man standing holding remote control.
  CROWD OF EXCITED GUESTS in background - some holding phones, others clapping.
  Blue smoke clouds. Sunny day. FESTIVE ATMOSPHERE with 20+ attendees visible. Cinematic."
  ```

  ### CROWD CONSISTENCY RULES:

  1. **If scene is PUBLIC EVENT** → ALWAYS include crowd/attendees
  2. **If previous shot showed crowd** → Next shot must ALSO show crowd (consistency!)
  3. **Even in CLOSE-UP** → Add "blurred crowd in background" or "out-of-focus guests behind"
  4. **EXCEPTION: Private moment** → Character INTENTIONALLY alone (explain in prompt: "sneaked away from party")

  ### BACKGROUND ELEMENTS FOR DIFFERENT EMOTIONS:

  | Emotion | Background Should Show |
  |---------|----------------------|
  | ISOLATION | Character SEPARATED from crowd, crowd DISTANT or BLURRED |
  | CELEBRATION | Crowd CLOSE, ENGAGED, CHEERING |
  | TENSION | Crowd SILENT, STARING, FROZEN |
  | REVELATION | Crowd GASPING, SHOCKED expressions |
  | EMBARRASSMENT | Crowd WHISPERING, POINTING, JUDGING |

  **EXAMPLE - Gender Reveal Scene:**
  ```
  Shot 1 (Wide): "Party setup. 30+ GUESTS gathered around decorated area,
                  holding drinks, EXCITED ANTICIPATION on faces..."

  Shot 2 (Close-up main character): "Man's face. BLURRED CROWD visible
                                     behind him, their festive clothes out of focus..."

  Shot 3 (Reaction): "Woman smiling. GUESTS in background CHEERING,
                      some with phones recording..."

  Shot 4 (Revelation): "Smoke explodes. CROWD GASPS, hands covering mouths,
                        SHOCKED expressions spreading through attendees..."
  ```

  ## 🔥 HOOK RULES (FIRST 30 SECONDS) - CRITICAL FOR VIEWER RETENTION! 🔥

  The HOOK (first 15-30 seconds) determines if viewers stay or leave!

  **MANDATORY FOR HOOK:**
  - First shot: DRAMATIC WIDE or LOW ANGLE (NOT boring Medium shot!)
  - Use tension, drama, mystery - make viewer curious
  - Strong emotions: shock, curiosity, "WTF?!" reaction
  - Contrast: tiny person vs huge environment, darkness vs light
  - NO generic "person sitting" or "person standing" shots!

  **HOOK VISUAL EXAMPLES:**
  - ✅ "LOW ANGLE: Tiny figure ALONE on massive courthouse steps, OVERWHELMING storm clouds"
  - ✅ "WIDE: Empty wedding venue with single ABANDONED dress on altar, dramatic shadows"
  - ✅ "CLOSE-UP: Tear rolling down cheek, hand CRUMPLING legal papers, devastation"
  - ❌ "Medium shot: Woman sitting in room looking thoughtful" (BORING - viewer leaves!)
  - ❌ "Medium shot: Person standing, calm expression" (NO DRAMA - FAIL!)

  ## 📷 CAMERA VARIETY LOGIC - AUTO CHANGE BY STORY BEAT!

  **🎬 STORY BEAT → CAMERA RULE:**

  | Story Beat | Required Camera | Why |
  |------------|-----------------|-----|
  | NEW LOCATION/SCENE | WIDE ESTABLISHING | Set context, show environment |
  | INTRODUCTION | FULL/MEDIUM | Show character in context |
  | RISING ACTION | MEDIUM → CLOSE-UP | Build tension, get closer |
  | DIALOGUE/CONFLICT | OTS or TWO-SHOT | Show relationship |
  | EMOTIONAL CLIMAX | EXTREME CLOSE-UP | Maximum impact on face |
  | REALIZATION | CLOSE-UP → WIDE | From intimate to show consequence |
  | TENSION/DANGER | DUTCH + LOW | Unstable, threatening |
  | RESOLUTION | WIDE or MEDIUM | Breathe, context |
  | TRANSITION | OBJECT/DETAIL | Bridge between scenes |

  **🔄 AUTOMATIC VARIETY RULES:**

  1. **NEVER** repeat same shot type 3 times in a row!
  2. **PATTERN:** Wide → Medium → Close → Detail → Wide (cycle)
  3. **EMOTIONAL BUILD:** Shots get TIGHTER as emotion intensifies
  4. **RELEASE:** After climax, pull WIDER to let audience breathe

  **EXAMPLE SEQUENCE:**
  ```
  Shot 1: WIDE (New location - courthouse)
  Shot 2: MEDIUM (Show character approaching)
  Shot 3: CLOSE-UP (Face shows fear)
  Shot 4: EXTREME CU (Trembling hands on papers)
  Shot 5: WIDE (Tiny person vs huge courthouse) ← CLIMAX
  Shot 6: OTS (Looking at door) ← TRANSITION
  ```

  ## 💡 LIGHTING CONSISTENCY - SYNC WITH LOCATION!

  **LOCATION → LIGHTING RULE:**

  | Location Type | Time of Day | Lighting Style | Colors |
  |---------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
  | COURTHOUSE | Any | COLD, harsh, institutional | Desaturated, gray-blue |
  | OLD HOME | Memory | GOLDEN HOUR, warm | Warm, nostalgic, amber |
  | HOSPITAL | Day | FLUORESCENT, clinical | Green-white, sterile |
  | OFFICE | Day | SOFT KEY LIGHT | Neutral, professional |
  | STREET | Night | BLUE HOUR + street lights | Cold blue + warm pools |
  | BEDROOM | Morning | SOFT, warm window light | Warm, peaceful |
  | RESTAURANT | Evening | WARM AMBIENT | Warm, romantic, tungsten |
  | CONSTRUCTION | Day | HARSH SUNLIGHT | High contrast, hot |
  | MARKET | Afternoon | OVERCAST or GOLDEN | Warm but realistic |

  **⚠️ CONSISTENCY RULES:**
  1. **SAME LOCATION = SAME LIGHTING** (don't change lighting within a location unless time passes!)
  2. **FLASHBACK = WARMER** (memories are always slightly golden/warmer)
  3. **PRESENT = COOLER** (current timeline is more neutral/cooler)
  4. **CONFLICT = HARSHER** (more contrast, harder shadows)

  **VARY SUBJECTS - NOT JUST MAIN CHARACTER!**
  - Include: environment shots, object details, hands/actions
  - Show: locations without people, symbolic objects, weather/mood
  - Example: "Close-up of wedding ring being removed", "Wide shot of empty house"

  | 3 | **MEDIUM SHOT** | 50mm | Character waist-up | Standard conversation, balance |
  | 4 | **MEDIUM CLOSE-UP** | 70mm | Chest to head | Intimacy, importance |
  | 5 | **CLOSE-UP** | 85mm | Face only | Raw emotion, connection, intensity |
  | 6 | **EXTREME CLOSE-UP** | 100mm+ | Eyes, hands, objects | Detail, tension, symbolic meaning |
  | 7 | **OVER-SHOULDER (OTS)** | 50mm | From behind one character | Relationship, conversation, POV |
  | 8 | **TWO-SHOT** | 50mm | Two characters in frame | Relationship dynamic, comparison |
  | 9 | **POV SHOT** | 35mm | What character sees | Immersion, subjective experience |
  | 10 | **DUTCH ANGLE** | Any | Tilted frame | Unease, tension, chaos, madness |
  | 11 | **SILHOUETTE** | 24mm | Backlit figure | Mystery, drama, artistic |
  | 12 | **REFLECTION** | 50mm | Through mirror/window | Introspection, dual nature |

  ### CAMERA ANGLES (5 Essential):

  | Angle | When to Use | Emotional Effect |
  |-------|-------------|------------------|
  | **EYE LEVEL** | Standard, neutral | Normal, relatable |
  | **LOW ANGLE** (Looking up) | Power, heroic moment | Makes subject DOMINANT, powerful |
  | **HIGH ANGLE** (Looking down) | Vulnerability, weakness | Makes subject SMALL, weak, trapped |
  | **BIRD'S EYE** (Directly above) | God's view, fate | Detachment, insignificance |
  | **WORM'S EYE** (Ground level) | Extreme power/drama | Maximum intimidation, epic feel |

  ### LIGHTING TECHNIQUES (5 Essential):

  | Technique | When to Use | Emotional Effect |
  |-----------|-------------|------------------|
  | **KEY LIGHT** (Soft, even) | Happy, normal scenes | Safety, clarity |
  | **HIGH CONTRAST** (Harsh shadows) | Conflict, tension | Drama, danger, inner conflict |
  | **SILHOUETTE** (Backlit) | Mystery, drama | Unknown, foreboding |
  | **GOLDEN HOUR** (Warm glow) | Nostalgia, love, hope | Warmth, beauty, fleeting moment |
  | **BLUE HOUR** (Cold light) | Sadness, isolation | Melancholy, loneliness |

  ### 🎬 CHOOSING THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE:

  **ASK YOURSELF:**
  1. What EMOTION should audience feel? → Choose lighting
  2. How POWERFUL is this character now? → Choose angle
  3. How INTIMATE should we be? → Choose shot size
  4. Is this moment STABLE or UNSTABLE? → Normal or Dutch angle

  **EXAMPLES:**

  | Story Moment | Technique Combo | Why |
  |--------------|-----------------|-----|
  | Mother sues son | LOW ANGLE + DUTCH + COLD LIGHT | Courthouse is powerful, world is wrong |
  | Happy childhood memory | MEDIUM + EYE LEVEL + GOLDEN HOUR | Intimate, warm, nostalgic |
  | Son's sacrifice | CLOSE-UP + LOW CONTRAST + WARM | Focus on emotion, determination |
  | Betrayal reveal | EXTREME CU + HIGH CONTRAST | Intense emotion, harsh truth |
  | Lonely moment | WIDE + HIGH ANGLE + BLUE LIGHT | Small person, big empty world |

  ## 🎬 SHOT TYPE RULES - CRITICAL FOR CINEMATIC FEEL!

  ### HOOK (First 3-5 scenes) - MUST BE DRAMATIC!
  - Scene 1: WIDE or LOW ANGLE (establish drama, NOT boring medium shot!)
  - Scene 2-3: Mix of CLOSE-UP (emotion) + WIDE (context)
  - NO "Medium shot person sitting" for hook - BORING!

  ### SHOT TYPE cho tung loai content:
  | Content Type | Shot Type | Example |
  |--------------|-----------|---------|
  | Emotion/Betrayal/Shock | CLOSE-UP, 85mm | Face with tears, clenched jaw |

  ## !!! CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST !!!

  SHOW THE MEMORY, NOT THE PERSON REMEMBERING!

  WRONG: "When I was a kid..." → 30yo man at courthouse thinking
  RIGHT: "When I was a kid..." → 8yo CHILD + 32yo MOTHER in apartment!

  WRONG: "My mother worked two jobs" → 30yo man talking about mom
  RIGHT: "My mother worked two jobs" → 32yo MOTHER at dry cleaning shop!

  WRONG: "I built my house" → 30yo man at courthouse
  RIGHT: "I built my house" → 28yo MAN hammering at construction site!

  ## !!! CHILD POLICY - API SAFETY !!!

  CHILDREN (is_child=true) → NO REFERENCE IMAGE!
  - Do NOT include child IDs in reference_files (causes API policy violation)
  - Instead: DESCRIBE child FULLY in img_prompt using character_lock
  - Only use adult + location references

  Example for CHILDHOOD scene:
  ```
  characters_in_scene: ["nv1_young", "nvc1"]     // Both listed here
  reference_files: ["nv1_young.png", "loc_apartment.png"]  // NO nvc1.png!
  img_prompt: "...32yo mother HUGGING a young 8-year-old boy with messy brown hair, innocent blue eyes, freckles, wearing old faded t-shirt..."
  ```
  ↑ Child described INLINE, not referenced!

  ## DECISION TREE - For EACH SRT segment:

  Q1: Does it mention CHILDHOOD or MOTHER'S SACRIFICE?
      Keywords: "when I was a kid", "my mother", "she worked", "growing up"
      → scene_type: CHILDHOOD_FLASHBACK
      → characters: ["nv1_young"] or ["nv1_young", "nvc1"]
      → location: loc_dryclean, loc_apartment, loc_convenience
      → SHOW: 32yo mother + 8yo child, NOT 30yo narrator!

  Q2: Does it mention BUILDING HOUSE or CAREER (narrator alone)?
      Keywords: "I built", "carpenter", "saved money", "bought land"
      → scene_type: ADULT_FLASHBACK
      → characters: ["nvc_young"]
      → location: loc_construction, loc_land
      → SHOW: 28yo man working, NOT 30yo narrator talking!

  Q2b: ADULT FLASHBACK with MOTHER present?
      Keywords: "she walked in", "mom came", "she hugged", "she said", "proud of you"
      → scene_type: ADULT_FLASHBACK
      → characters: ["nvc_young", "nv1"]
      → location: loc_finished_house
      → SHOW: 28yo man + 55yo mother together!
      → NOTE: Use nv1 (55yo), NOT nv1_young (32yo) - mother is older now!

  Q3: Is it PRESENT MOMENT?
      Keywords: "right now", "sitting here", "today", "courthouse"
      → scene_type: FRAME_PRESENT
      → characters: ["nvc"]
      → location: loc_courthouse
      → SHOW: 30yo narrator at courthouse with ACTION

  Q4: Is it YOUTUBE CTA?
      Keywords: "subscribe", "like button", "comment"
      → scene_type: YOUTUBE_CTA
      → characters: ["nvc"]
      → location: KEEP CURRENT STORY LOCATION (don't use "plain background"!)
      → SHOW: Narrator at SAME LOCATION, same SERIOUS expression
      → EMOTION: Match story context! If story is heavy → SERIOUS face, NOT smiling!
      → NOTE: CTA does NOT mean happy! Keep the emotional weight of the story!

  ## !!! EMOTION MATCHING - CRITICAL !!!

  NEVER use "SMILING" by default! Match emotion to CONTENT:

  | Content Type | WRONG | CORRECT Emotion |
  |--------------|-------|-----------------|
  | "10 years hard work" | SMILING | DETERMINED, sweat on face, EXHAUSTED but PROUD |
  | "I became a carpenter" | HOLDING hammer | SWINGING hammer, FOCUSED expression |
  | "Mom worked 2 jobs" | SMILING mother | EXHAUSTED face, dark circles, WEARY but LOVING |
  | "$72,000 every penny" | Casual smile | SERIOUS face, weight of decision |
  | "She took me to court" | SMILING | SHOCKED, BETRAYED, disbelief |
  | "We had nothing" | SMILING | WORRIED, STRUGGLING, but HOPEFUL |
  | "I built this house" | HOLDING blueprints | HAMMERING, SAWING, SWEATING |

  ## ACTION VERBS - Use ACTIVE not PASSIVE:

  | WRONG (passive) | CORRECT (active) |
  |-----------------|------------------|
  | HOLDING hammer | SWINGING hammer, HAMMERING nails |
  | HOLDING blueprints | STUDYING blueprints, POINTING at plans |
  | HOLDING documents | CLUTCHING documents, READING papers |
  | Standing with tools | WORKING, BUILDING, SAWING wood |
  | Sitting with food | EATING, COOKING, SERVING food |

  ## EMOTIONAL WEIGHT GUIDE:

  - SACRIFICE content → tired, weary, exhausted, determined
  - HARD WORK content → sweating, focused, strained, working hard
  - POVERTY content → worried, struggling, worn clothing, humble
  - BETRAYAL content → shocked, hurt, disbelief, pain
  - SUCCESS content → proud, accomplished, satisfied (OK to smile here)
  - CHILDHOOD HAPPY → nostalgic warmth, innocent joy (OK to smile here)

  ## 🔥🔥🔥 HOOK (Scene 1-3) - MOST IMPORTANT! VIEWER DECIDES TO STAY OR LEAVE! 🔥🔥🔥

  ### HOOK GOAL: Make viewer think "WTF? I MUST know what happens next!"

  ### SCENE 1 - THE GRABBER (CRITICAL!!!):
  - Shot: WIDE LOW ANGLE or EXTREME WIDE
  - ⚠️ MUST INCLUDE CHARACTER! NOT just empty location!
  - Character must look: DEVASTATED, ISOLATED, OVERWHELMED
  - Environment TOWERS over character (imposing, dramatic contrast)
  - Emotion: Shock, despair, "rock bottom" moment
  - Example: "TINY figure hunched ALONE on MASSIVE courthouse steps, documents SCATTERED"
  - ❌ WRONG: Just courthouse without person
  - ❌ WRONG: Person standing normally

  ### SCENE 2 - THE EMOTION:
  - Shot: EXTREME CLOSE-UP on FACE
  - Show RAW emotion: tears welling, jaw clenched, trembling lips
  - Eyes must tell the story: pain, betrayal, disbelief
  - Example: "Face filling frame, eyes RED and WELLING with tears, TREMBLING lips"

  ### SCENE 3 - THE DETAIL:
  - Shot: EXTREME CLOSE-UP on symbolic object/action
  - Hands trembling, clutching documents, wedding ring, etc.
  - Creates mystery: "What happened? What are those papers?"
  - Example: "TREMBLING hands CLUTCHING crumpled legal documents, knuckles WHITE"

  ### ❌ BANNED for HOOK:
  - Empty location shots (boring!)
  - Medium shot person sitting/standing calmly
  - Neutral expressions
  - Person looking at camera
  - "Smiling" or any positive emotion (this is drama!)

  ## 🎬 SHOT TYPE RULES - CRITICAL FOR CINEMATIC VARIETY!

  ### SHOT TYPE per 5 scenes (MANDATORY MIX!):
  | Scene # | Required Shot Type | Purpose |
  |---------|-------------------|---------|
  | 1 | WIDE or LOW ANGLE | Establish context, drama |
  | 2 | CLOSE-UP | Emotion, face |
  | 3 | MEDIUM or OVER-SHOULDER | Action, relationship |
  | 4 | EXTREME CLOSE-UP | Detail (hands, object) |
  | 5 | WIDE or TWO-SHOT | Context or relationship |

  ### SHOT TYPE by content:
  | Content | Shot Type | Lens | Example |
  |---------|-----------|------|---------|
  | Courtroom/Legal | LOW ANGLE, WIDE | 24mm | Imposing courthouse towers over tiny figure |
  | Emotion/Betrayal | CLOSE-UP | 85mm | Face with tears, clenched jaw, trembling lips |
  | Hard Work | EXTREME CLOSE-UP | 100mm | Sweaty hands gripping hammer, calloused fingers |
  | Poverty/Struggle | WIDE | 24mm | Tiny figure in cramped apartment |
  | Building/Creating | LOW ANGLE | 35mm | Hero shot from below, power, determination |
  | Mother-Son moment | TWO-SHOT or OTS | 50mm | Two people, emotional connection |
  | Memory transition | WIDE + warm | 24mm | Nostalgic, golden hour lighting |

  ### ❌ BANNED PATTERNS - NEVER DO THIS!
  - 3+ MEDIUM shots in a row → BREAK with Close-up or Wide!
  - Same action 2x in a row (e.g., "SWINGING HAMMER" x2) → VARY the action!
  - Same character pose 2x → Change angle, distance, or action!
  - "Person sitting/standing" without ACTION → Add specific action!

  ### ✅ REQUIRED VARIETY per 10 scenes:
  - At least 2 WIDE shots (establishing, context)
  - At least 2 CLOSE-UP shots (emotion)
  - At least 1 EXTREME CLOSE-UP (detail shot)
  - At least 1 LOW ANGLE or HIGH ANGLE (drama)
  - Maximum 3 MEDIUM shots total!

  ## GLOBAL STYLE (MUST append to EVERY img_prompt!):
  {global_style}

  ## CHARACTERS:
  {characters_info}

  ## LOCATIONS:
  {locations_info}

  ## SRT SEGMENTS:
  {srt_with_timestamps}

  ## STYLE CONSISTENCY RULE:
  EVERY img_prompt MUST END with the GLOBAL STYLE above!
  This ensures all images have consistent colors and quality.

    ]
  }}

  ## YOUTUBE CTA - WRONG vs RIGHT:
  WRONG: "subscribe..." → SMILING, plain background, happy mood
  RIGHT: "subscribe..." → SAME LOCATION, SAME EMOTION as story, serious/reflective

  ## FINAL CHECKLIST:
  [ ] Every CHILDHOOD memory → nv1_young (32yo mother) NOT nv1!
  [ ] Every ADULT FLASHBACK with mother → nv1 (55yo) NOT nv1_young!
  [ ] Every BUILDING scene → nvc_young at construction NOT courthouse!
  [ ] Different memories = DIFFERENT locations!
  [ ] NO narration text in img_prompt!
  [ ] EMOTIONS match content (NO default SMILING!)
  [ ] ACTIONS are ACTIVE (SWINGING not HOLDING!)
  [ ] Hard work = DETERMINED/EXHAUSTED face, NOT smiling!
  [ ] Mother versions: CHILDHOOD=nv1_young(32), ADULT=nv1(55)!
  [ ] CHILDREN: NOT in reference_files! Describe FULLY in img_prompt!
  [ ] STYLE CONSISTENCY: Every img_prompt ends with GLOBAL STYLE!
  [ ] YOUTUBE CTA: Keep story location + emotion! NO smiling, NO plain background!
  [ ] CROWD CONSISTENCY: Party/wedding/event = ALWAYS include guests/crowd in background!
  [ ] Even CLOSE-UP shots: "blurred crowd behind", "guests visible in bokeh"

  ## 🔥 HOOK CHECKLIST (Scene 1-3) - MOST CRITICAL!:
  [ ] Scene 1: WIDE LOW ANGLE with CHARACTER visible (NOT empty location!)
  [ ] Scene 1: Character looks DEVASTATED, ISOLATED, OVERWHELMED
  [ ] Scene 2: EXTREME CLOSE-UP on FACE with RAW emotion (tears, pain)
  [ ] Scene 3: EXTREME CLOSE-UP on DETAIL (trembling hands, documents)
  [ ] NO smiling or neutral expressions in HOOK!
  [ ] HOOK creates question: "WTF happened? I must know!"

  ## 🎬 SHOT TYPE CHECKLIST:
  [ ] NO 3+ MEDIUM shots in a row!
  [ ] Per 10 scenes: 2+ WIDE, 2+ CLOSE-UP, 1+ EXTREME CLOSE-UP
  [ ] Maximum 3 MEDIUM shots per 10 scenes!
  [ ] shot_type field included for EVERY scene!
  [ ] Different shot_type from previous scene!
